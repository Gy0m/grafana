Grafana supports many ways to authenticate users. The authentication setup determines which users have access to Grafana and how they log in to Grafana.
You can also configure Grafana to manage users' roles and team memberships based on the information returned by the auth provider integration.

When choosing which authentication mechanism to use, you should consider the current identity and access management setup that you or your organization have, and the authentication and authorization features that you want to utilise.
For a full list of the available authentication options and features supported by them refer to [Configure authentication]({{< relref "/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-security/configure-authentication" >}}).
