There are numerous authentication methods available in Grafana to verify user identity. The authentication configuration dictates which users can access Grafana and the methods they can use for logging in.
You can also configure Grafana to manage users' roles and team memberships based on the information returned by the auth provider integration.

When choosing which authentication mechanism to use, you should consider the current identity and access management setup that you or your organization have, and the authentication and authorization features that you want to utilise.
For a complete list of the available authentication options and the features they support, refer to [Configure authentication]({{< relref "/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-security/configure-authentication" >}}).
